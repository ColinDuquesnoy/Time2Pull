Time2Pull is small application that monitors your local git repositories and
warns you when a remote got updated, i.e. *it's time to pull!*

This is particularly useful if you're working with a centralised workflow
(where all developers pull and push from a central repository) and want to
be quickly notified anytime the remote got updated.


How does it work?
=================

First, you add the paths to the local repositories you would like to monitor.

Then, the application will scan the added repositories every minutes to detect remote status changes.

The scan simply consists in calling the two following git commands and parsing their output::

  $ git remote update
  $ git status -uno
  
If the repository is behind its origin, the application will warn you by displaying a message in the system 
tray and by playing an alert sound.


Features
========

- cross platform: run on Windows, Mac OSX and GNU/Linux
- free and open source, built upon FOSS technologies (Python, Qt, Git)
- detects pullable commits and warns you!
- detects pushable commits (just for information)
- detects uncommitted changes (just for information)
- nice and explicit icon overlays for each state
- you can choose between a dark and a white tray icon for a better integration with your desktop
